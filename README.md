PaginationHelper is designed to take in an array of objects and an integer indicating how many items will be allowed per each page. The types of values contained within the collection/array are not relevant. This class could be used for implementation of pagination UI components.

Tests can be ran through the PaginationHelperTest.java class, or by running the testng.xml. Test requiring inputs are divided into two categories, negative testing and positive testing. If desired, further work could be done to further break down test cases.
